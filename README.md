# activation
+ open the powershell of the folder where the files at and type:
```bash
node index
```
and press enter

**__if the command isn't working go to https://nodejs.org/en and install the TLS version and try again after finishing the installation process__**
+ after that the application will read the request.txt file and will create your request inside the product folder
+ after the powershell window stopped typing text you can safely close the powershell window and go into the product folder

## how to activate your discord bot
+ after entering the product folder open the powershell of the product folder and type:
```bash
node index
```
and press enter
**the bot will be active as long as this window running (i highly recommend to buy a server on the internet or to use a small pc if you got one laying around that isn't in use and look on youtube how to turn that pc to a home server)**
now your discord bot is up and running, if something isn't working just redo the activation steps and reactivate the bot again

# common problems
+ **__If the bot crashes with error "Missing Permissions" try putting the bot's role higher in the role list__** 
+ **If your bot crash while trying to make an action that involving a user that isn't a member of the server if you can change it to a user that's a member of the server. Discord bots aren't allowed to interact with users outside your guild (the server that the action came from)**

# common questions
**q: How do I even get those ids**

**a:Go to your discord setting and in Advance turn on Developer Mode. After turning on developer mode right click on the thing you want its id (a channel, a server, a user, etc...) and click copy id (the last option)**
